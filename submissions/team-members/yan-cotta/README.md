# Smart Leaf Disease Classification

This project implements a deep learning solution for classifying crop diseases from leaf images, focusing on crops common in Bangladesh, such as corn, potato, rice, and wheat. The project leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify 14 disease classes, addressing challenges like class imbalance and image variability through robust preprocessing and optimization techniques.

## Progress (as of May 10, 2025)

### Step 1: Environment Setup

- Configured a reproducible environment with requirements.txt and verify_setup.py
- Ensured all dependencies (PyTorch, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, etc.) are installed
- Set random seeds (RANDOM_SEED = 42) for reproducibility

### Step 2: Baseline Model Evaluation

- Trained and evaluated a custom CNN (LeafDiseaseClassifier) using 5-fold cross-validation (3 epochs per fold)
- Achieved an average F1-score of 0.739 and validation loss of 0.487
- Identified strong classes (F1 > 0.9): Corn___Common_Rust, Corn___Healthy, Potato___Early_Blight, Potato___Late_Blight, Rice___Neck_Blast
- Noted problematic classes (F1 < 0.7): Rice___Leaf_Blast (0.2975), Rice___Healthy (0.4978), Rice___Brown_Spot (0.5184), Corn___Gray_Leaf_Spot (0.5237), Corn___Northern_Leaf_Blight (0.6895)
- Generated five confusion matrices and an aggregated metrics plot
- Documented findings in scripts/outputs/baseline_summary.txt
- Fixed a plotting error in plot_aggregated_metrics to generate aggregated_class_metrics.png

### Step 3: Addressing Class Imbalance
- Implemented class weights using CrossEntropyLoss instead of oversampling
- Achieved significant improvements:
  - Average F1 Score increased to 0.804 (from baseline 0.7620)
  - Average Validation Loss decreased to 0.409 (from baseline 0.4870)
- Generated comprehensive fold-wise metrics:
  - Fold 1: F1 = 0.792, Val Loss = 0.4591
  - Fold 2: F1 = 0.854, Val Loss = 0.3772
  - Fold 3: F1 = 0.828, Val Loss = 0.3326
  - Fold 4: F1 = 0.700, Val Loss = 0.5522
  - Fold 5: F1 = 0.845, Val Loss = 0.3236
- Identified areas for improvement in rice disease classification

### Step 4: Model Optimization
- Increased training epochs to 10 per fold for better convergence
- Fixed hyperparameters:
  - Learning Rate: 0.001
  - Batch Size: 32
  - Dropout Rate: 0.3
- Enhanced model training stability with consistent decrease in train loss
- Applied class weights effectively (e.g., 6.1203 for Potato___Healthy)

### Current Status and Next Steps
- **Strengths**: 
  - Excellent performance on Corn___Healthy and Rice___Neck_Blast
  - Improved overall metrics across most classes
  - Stable training with consistent loss reduction
- **Challenges**: 
  - Rice___Leaf_Blast and Rice___Healthy still show suboptimal performance
  - Some feature confusion between rice disease classes
- **Next Steps**:
  - Enhance model robustness for rice classes
  - Explore additional data augmentation techniques
  - Fine-tune hyperparameters for problematic classes

## Performance Metrics

### Latest Evaluation Results

  - Effective class weight application for balance

### Visualization Highlights

- Confusion matrices reveal specific areas for improvement
- Detailed metrics available in scripts/outputs/evaluation_results.json

## Utilities (utils/data_utils.py)

- **Image Validation**: Verifies image integrity to exclude corrupt files
- **Class Distribution**: Visualizes class distribution (class_distribution.png) to identify imbalances
- **Class Weights**: Computes weights for loss function to mitigate class imbalance

## Running the Streamlit Application

To visualize predictions on your own leaf images, you can use the Streamlit application.

1.  **Ensure Dependencies are Installed**:
    If you haven't already, install all necessary packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Ensure your virtual environment is activated.)

2.  **Navigate to the Correct Directory**:
    The Streamlit app `app.py` is located in the `submissions/team-members/yan-cotta/` directory. The command to run it should typically be executed from the project root directory (`SDS-CP028-smart-leaf`) or from within the `submissions/team-members/yan-cotta/` directory if you adjust paths accordingly. Assuming you are in the `submissions/team-members/yan-cotta` directory:
    ```bash
    # If you are in SDS-CP028-smart-leaf/ (project root):
    # cd submissions/team-members/yan-cotta 
    # Or, if already in submissions/team-members/yan-cotta/, you can proceed.
    ```

3.  **Ensure the Model is Available**:
    The Streamlit application requires the trained model file `best_leaf_disease_model.pth`. This file is generated by the model evaluation script. If it's not present in `submissions/team-members/yan-cotta/scripts/outputs/`, run the evaluation first:
    ```bash
    python scripts/model_evaluation.py
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit App**:
    Once the dependencies are installed and the model file is available, start the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    This will typically open the application in your default web browser.
